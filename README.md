# Billy - Network Architecture Management Tool - Final Project Proof-of-Concept
This project introduces Billy, which is a web-based network architecture management tool purposely designed to assist network engineers to manage hardware inventories and network diagrams, together with performing firmware vulnerability security analysis. As opposed to focusing only on network diagramming, the project evolved in order to address a much critical gap in proactive security assessment in network infrastructures. Billy absorbs a dataset, designs a network diagram, performs live firewall interrogations via SSH and outputs a security risk prediction, making use of survival analysis machine learning.
